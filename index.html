<h1>Hi, I'm Emily.</h1>
<p>
  I'm a professional urban nerd currently developing a coding habit.
  <br>
  I work for Weston Urban, a real estate development company in downtown San Antonio. Before that, I worked at the 80/20 Foundation administering grants to public charities working to improve San Antonio's urban core, technology education, and entrepreneurship scene. I found my way to San Antonio as a 2014 Venture for America Fellow.

  If you're interested in saying hi, feel free to reach out on email, Twitter, Github, LinkedIn, whatever suits.
